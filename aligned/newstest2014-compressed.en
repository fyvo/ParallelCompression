a black box in your car ? 
as America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a highway system , many see a solution in a black box that fits by the dashboard .
the devices , which track every mile and transmit that information , are a controversial attempt in state planning offices to overhaul the system for funding major roads . 
highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate . 
libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to use the boxes to keep track of miles to draw up a tax bill . 
the tea party is aghast . 
the American Civil Liberties Union is concerned , raising privacy issues . 
while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting . 
they are exploring how they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road . 
thousands of motorists have already taken the boxes for a test drive . 
this really is a must for our nation . 
" it is not a matter of something we might choose to do , " said executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments , which is planning to start tracking miles by California motorist by 2025 .
there is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes . 
the technology is there to do it . 
the push comes as the Highway Trust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke . 
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to .
cars get many more miles to the gallon . 
the federal tax hasn't gone up in 20 years . 
politicians are loath to raise the tax when gas prices are high . 
" the gas tax is just not sustainable , " said a transportation policy expert .
his state recently put devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system . 
" this works out as the most logical alternative , " he said .
wonks call it a mileage-based user fee . 
the idea appeals to urban liberals , as the taxes could change driving patterns in ways that reduce congestion and greenhouse gases .
California planners are looking to the system to meet the goals in the state's global warming laws .
but chairman of the House Transportation Committee said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .
" this is not just a tax , " said vice president of policy at Reason .
people are paying into what they are getting . 
the movement is also bolstered by two former U. S. Transportation secretaries , who in 2011 urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction . 
the Senate approved a pilot project last year that would have involved about 10000 cars . 
but the House leadership killed the proposal , on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose lives involve logging lots of miles .
several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead .
Oregon is enlisting 5000 drivers in the biggest experiment .
those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes . 
Nevada has already completed a pilot . 
New York City is looking into one . 
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks . 
and the I-95 Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments , is studying how they could .
the concept is not a universal hit . 
in Nevada , where volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices , drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
" concerns about Big Brother were a major problem , " said Alauddin Khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation .
it was not something people wanted . 
as the trial got underway , the ACLU of Nevada warned : " it would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full fledged tracking devices . "
there is no need to build an enormous technological infrastructure that will be expanded to keep records of comings and goings . 
Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology to keep track of miles , but not exactly where and at what time .
if you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable . 
the hunt for that technology has led some agencies to a startup called True Mileage . 
the firm was not originally in the business .
it was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage . 
but the devices appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , uploaded periodically . 
" people will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and their location , " said chief executive of True Mileage .
there have been some mistakes in these state pilot programs . 
there are less expensive and intrusive ways . 
in Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices . 
they can choose a device with or without GPS . 
they can choose not to have a device , opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average by all state residents .
other places are hoping to sell the concept by having the devices do more . 
in New York City , officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would pay parking meter fees , provide " pay-as-you-drive " insurance , and create speed data from other drivers to avoid traffic . 
" motorists would participate because of the benefits , " says a city planning document . 
some transportation planners wonder if paying by the mile is just a giant distraction . 
at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes . 
an extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas .
" there is no need for surgery when you need to take an aspirin , " said the commission's director of legislation and public affairs . 
if we do this , millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy .
Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash 
with a statue of Samora Machel , Mozambique's founding president , staring down on them , thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans .
" we want peace back ; we want stability , " said Vanessa de Sousa , chief executive of an investment company . 
she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with " we demand security " as she joined the crowds on Thursday .
for two weeks , there have been daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , some of the worst since a peace deal more than 20 years ago . 
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government to destabilise the country's independent government . 
after a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party . 
the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict , but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals .
the stakes are high for the economy as the discovery of offshore gas reserves and coal deposits could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies . 
the ruling FRELIMO party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other .
RENAMO says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack in Sofala province , a Renamo stronghold , on October 17 . 
assaults escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill the group's leader , Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times . 
the government blames Renamo for attacking soldiers .
President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability . 
Guebuza told the French news agency on Wednesday that Dhlakama wanted to use " his forces to impose on the government his own decisions . "
both FRELIMO and Renamo insist they want to avoid war . 
but concerns have grown after Mazanga was quoted saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord . 
he told that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by FRELIMO . 
" our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seriousness , " Mazanga said . 
previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions .
" it's two big men butting heads together , " said a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert . 
neither of them are prepared to make the concessions that are necessary . 
RENAMO , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had already said it would boycott municipal elections in November . 
presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year . 
commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt to win concessions and financial spoils . 
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992 , while a newer party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique ( MDM ) , is expected to improve its showing at the elections . 
Mazanga says Guebuza - due to step down when his second term ends - wants to destroy the country's democracy . 
" he does not want multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , " Mazanga said .
it is unclear how much capacity Renamo has , but it has carried out attacks on police stations and vehicles . 
most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province , several hundred kilometres north of Maputo but hosts the port that miners rely on to export coal . 
in June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line .
Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat . 
Renamo wanted to " warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique , " Mazanga said . 
instability has added to frustrations with the government , says an independent media company , with people concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent kidnappings .
" people think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , " he says . 
a demonstrator said people just wanted stability . 
" no one cares about Renamo and FRELIMO , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , " he said . 
ceremony in Memory of the Cremated 
the Père Lachaise crematorium is organizing a ceremony in memory of all those cremated this year .
Anne Hidalgo , socialist candidate for Paris mayorship , is expected to attend and explain her proposals on funerary matters . 
click above to watch the ceremony . 
more and more French people are choosing cremation for their own funerals - 53 % , according to an Ipsos survey carried out among 1009 people . 
it is the opposite for the funeral of a loved one - the French prefer inhumation ( 53 % ) . 
only 15 % of those who lose a child choose cremation . 
in his book , La Mort en Cendres , Damien Le Guay , philosopher and vice-chairperson of the Comité National d'Ethique du Funéraire emphasises the " violence " that cremation represents .
there is a sense of " violence committed against the body of a loved one " , which will be " reduced to a pile of ashes " in a very short time instead of after a process of decomposition that " would accompany the stages of grief " .
there is also a " symbolic violence " that relates to the " obliteration of the person's singularity " .
why is this accepted in certain Nordic and protestant countries , but is still taken badly in France ? 
" because cremation is a recent development , " says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué , president of the Thanatological Society and author of the book Apprivoiser la Mort . 
the Catholic Church only started tolerating it in 1963 .
for François Michaud-Nérard , director general of Funerary Services for the City of Paris , getting to grips with cremation is about giving the deceased a ceremony as dignified as with inhumation .
the Ipsos survey shows the attachment to the ceremony . 
77 % of French want one for their loved ones , be it religious ( 53 % ) or civil ( 24 % ) . 
nowadays , 73 % of people choosing cremation want a ceremony . 
66 % of atheists or non-believers also want one . 
crematoria have adapted to this change .
" they have been trying to spare families from the violence in waiting followed by their being handed the ashes , " observes Michaud-Nérard . 
70 % of establishments now offer a master of ceremonies to conduct the ritual in the presence of the body : greet the congregation , mention the deceased by name , connect the deceased to those present , evoke who the person was , give sense to their death , organise a farewell . 
this is what has been happening at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998 . 
the masters of ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment . 
there are also former Catholic priests . 
it is in this context that , since 2010 , the crematorium has been organising memorial ceremonies , lay and non-religious , on All Saints Day , to which it invites the families of those who have been cremated during the year . 
for the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies has been relayed online .
the crematorium has authorised us to broadcast it . 
Ukraine Close to Economic Collapse 
rating agency , Standard & Poor's , reduced Ukraine's credit rating on Friday , casting a doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic to meet its financial obligations .
the debt rating moved to B- .
this rating is accompanied by a negative outlook , with S & P seeing at least one chance in three that it will downgrade the rating in the next year . 
" it is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will make it possible to sufficiently guarantee foreign currencies to meet its increased external financial commitments , " explained the American agency . 
the agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 , and the trend is expected to continue . 
this complicates the repayment of credit from abroad . 
these reserves are collapsing , leading to the agency considering devaluation more likely , which would inflate the country's foreign debt .
moreover , Kiev needs liquid assets to pay for its gas imports from Russia , which accuses it of not having paid a bill of 882 million dollars .
the announcement comes as bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of tension with its Russian neighbour , which is furious with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November . 
this was made public the day after the publication of statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarterly drop between July and September . 
its debt has exploded in recent years . S & P estimates it as 33.5 % of the GDP , as opposed to 10 % prior to the crisis of 2008-2009 . 
experiencing a budgetary deficit , the country has been asking for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months . the latter , in 2010 , had given the former a 15300 million dollars loan , but this time has released just 3400 million . 
the IMF is refusing to pay until the country has adopted unpopular reforms .
the IMF noted this week that " the significant need for external finance " represented " a weakness " , even though there were " signs of economic improvement " .
however , for the economist Oleksandr Joloud from the Centre for Political Studies , " no improvement can be expected in the short term " . 
" there is little hope of unpopular reforms being made in a pre-election year , " said the expert in an AFP interview . presidential elections are planned for 2015 . 
the only hope is for an improvement in international circumstances . 
S & P notes the " uncertainty " linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU .
" signing the agreement would be good for business in the long term , but it might have negative consequences in the short term in relation to Russia's reaction , " explained S & P , concerned Moscow may introduce " trade restrictions " . 
Russia , responsible for a quarter of Ukrainian exports , has warned that if a free trade area is created it will have to reinforce its border controls for imported goods .
Ben Greenman : the Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : the New Yorker 
one could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the vaudevillian Frank Fay served as the master of ceremonies on Broadway telling jokes directly to the crowd . 
Fay's innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Comedy Festival . 
created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the standup institution Carolines , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary , with more than sixty shows .
" most of these headliners appeared at Carolines , and went on to greater success , " Hirsch said .
we built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them . 
this year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin , and Bill Maher , as well as " Stand Up for Heroes , " an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans , at Madison Square Garden , featuring , among others , Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters , and Bill Cosby . 
as the festival has expanded , so has the world of comedy . 
several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through shows on smaller networks .
Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show . 
Jenny Slate cast member on both " Saturday Night Live " and " parks and Recreation , " is best known for her viral video series " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On . " 
both Kroll and Slate , as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices , are products of the decentralized world of American comedy . 
one of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview : David Steinberg talking to Larry David . 
Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become television and film director , as well as an unofficial comedy historian . 
from 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a show on TV Land called " Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg . " 
the meeting takes place in the center of Manhattan . 
" the city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work , " Steinberg said . 
he was telling me that sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself , Hey , if I lose all my money , maybe I'll live here . 
" La Nouvelle Star " made a big comeback in terms of audiences , with 1.3 million TV viewers , a 5.6 % share of the audience . 
but was the show up to expectations ? 
some 10000 candidates turned up at the auditions to face the jury for this 10th season : Maurane , Sinclair , André Manoukian and Olivier Bas . 
the viewers shared their thoughts on Twitter . 
the excitement of finding their favorite programme having subsided , many are disappointed . 
but why where they so disappointed ? 
none of the contestants seem to have really stood out at first glance . 
as every year , the first audition shows threw in a variety of singers into the mix .
but , on Twitter , people want a spectacle , emotion , originality , music ... 
fortunately , a few got just that . 
many people have tried " La Nouvelle Star " , and some have even gotten through . 
behind the screens , there are always those cut out to be successful singers .
others are just out to make you laugh . 
repainted Traffic Lights : MP Asks Brigitte Grouwels to Resign 
not everyone is pleased with Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a " face-lift " . 
the Minister of Public Works and Transports had launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday , consisting in repainting 16 traffic light posts in the yellow and blue colours of the Brussels region . 
the aim of this is to both " increase safety " and " enhance the identity of Brussels " . 
the idea is to repaint all the traffic lights in Brussels , at an estimated cost of one million Euros . 
but the blue chosen is " too dark " , according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock , who talks of the " Flemishing " of the capital and is demanding the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels . 
" not content with spending Brussels residents' money like water on this scheme of giving traffic light posts a face-lift , Grouwels is continuing her efforts to turn the capital Flemish , " says an angry De Bock . 
after her mango yellow and black taxis , she has ended up repainting the posts in Brussels yellow , dark blue and black . 
according to the MP , there is now " no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels . 
the residents deserve better than their money wasted by a Christian Democratic and Flemish Minister .
it is high time the Flemish Trojan Horse was stopped . 
let's not forget , Grouwels was elected by 2245 votes , 0.5 % of Brussels inhabitants ! " de Bock concludes .

Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed 
Basharat Ditta would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough 
the solicitor feared his drug addiction would be exposed 
was given a three-year prison sentence 
a top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a police investigation , because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed , has been jailed for three years . 
Basharat Ditta would feed intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit . 
the solicitor was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough , who he had represented in a previous trial . 
officers spotted Sarborough dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in while he was out . 
inquiries revealed Ditta was a " regular user " of the Class A drug after tests  . 
over an eight month period he sought to obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates . 
all four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket . 
they were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine during a series of raids . 
Ditta fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed 
today Ditta was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court . 
he admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing . 
the lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in phone contact with Ditta in February 2011 . 
two detectives trailed the suspect arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs under the lawyer's bins . 
soon after the drop off , Scarborough was in phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner . 
the lawyer returned home to discover the drugs . 
the court heard Ditta was a " regular user " of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair and on his credit cards 
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client .
during his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken . 
in a police interview he said he ran an office at his home and clients would call at his house on legal business . 
but the court heard he would call players in the drugs supply chain after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew . 
prosecuting , Anne Whyte said : " if anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal solicitor . " 
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor . 
the relationship is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his lawyer with drugs . 
some of his communications will have been legitimate because he was their lawyer . 
but this went beyond the confines of a lawyer-client relationship . 
he thwarted the police's investigation to enable them to continue in their criminal activities . 
Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession , but dishonouring it . 
he got close to certain clients , in particular Scarborough . 
Ditta claimed : " if I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours . " 
but after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said : " Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself . " 
his addiction left him compromised and vulnerable to the motives of members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain information regarding police investigations . 
solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence . 
Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession . 
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice . 
let this case serve as a warning to criminals . 
we will put you before the courts . 
Scarborough was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin , cocaine and cannabis . 
thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed . 
on his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America . 
" plan to buy Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees , " titan CEO says 
after throwing in the towel in January over the partial taking over of the Goodyear site in Amiens North , which is due to close , Maurice Taylor , CEO of American tire manufacturer , Titan , now says that he is ready to save 333 of the factory's 1137 employees . 
Arnaud Montebourg , Minister of Industrial Recovery , had already announced this . 
after giving up the plan to buy the factory , today you are back . 
you had fired violent attacks , talking of ' so-called workers' who ' work three hours' a day , and ' mad ' unions , targeting the CGT . 
it's hard to understand this U-turn . 
is this meant to please Mr Montebourg ? 
I'm not trying to please anyone . 
except my wife . 
Mr Montebourg is a young man who is trying to save the best paid jobs . 
I'm sorry if my words have offended anyone . 
but there are high levels of tax and unemployment in France . 
does the truth offend you ? 
working seven hours a day is holding France back . 
in any other countries , people work ten to twelve hours a day . 
I don't have prejudices about France . 
what I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires , has good equipment , a good location and plenty of room for growth . 
why does Titan need this factory ? 
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory . 
if the price is right and the workers are qualified , it's worth trying . 
what agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear ? 
if Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance package after announcing that the closing , I think 100 % of the employees would have accepted it . 
let's imagine that Titan buys a closed factory from Goodyear . 
Titan could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any country in the European Union that has its currency . 
I think Mr Montebourg knows that . 
he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid employees . 
Titan has agreed to recruit them from the 1200 people working for Goodyear . 
Mr Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear . 
the first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay . 
then there won't be any employees left . 
Mr Montebourg has said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years . 
can you confirm that ? 
the number I mentioned to the minister is 333 . 
I know he would like a four-year guarantee . 
the CGT and Goodyear must first reach an agreement on the severance pay . 
if all the employees accept it , the project of buying Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees . 
how can we give guarantees on the length of employment when there are no employees on site ? 
if Mr Montebourg gets the CGT and Goodyear to reach an agreement and Titan buys the factory , we have intention of staying in Amiens North for more than four years . 
Cogeco Cable Soon to Offer Interactive TV ? 
Cogeco Cable subscribers may soon have access to applications like Facebook , Twitter and the Netflix service through their television in a distant future . 
the Cogeco subsidiary indicated that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the platform with some of users . 
" this will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and larger numbers of options , " explained the president and CEO of Cogeco , Louis Audet . 
Cogeco Cable is thus following its competitors , even though the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a launching date for this platform . 
" we need to adapt and change or resist change and fail , " emphasized Audet . 
the goal is to offer tools that our customers do not have access to . 
the telecommunications giant Rogers has indicated that it might offer Netflix if certain technical details could be sorted out . 
in the United States , the video service is said to be discussing the possibility of making its service available via their broadcasting platforms with some major cable companies . 
the CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government . 
Ottawa wants to force television providers to offer customers the option of accessing the services on a pay-per-view basis . 
" we have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to purchase major packages of channels doesn't work , " stated Audet . 
he hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) will give rise to interesting recommendations . 
" these discussions need to produce a new type of reference framework for the definition of the new cultural policy in Canada , " said Cogeco's CEO . 
the CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week , and these will be continued with the industry . 
Cogeco has said it has recorded a net profit of CAD 43.8 million . 
this is a drop compared to the net profit of CAD 44.9 million in the same period last year . 
the Montreal-based company says this drop is due to depreciation expenses . 
in 2012 Cogeco bought US-based Atlantic Broadband for CAD 1360 million . 
this was the company's first major acquisition after its failed attempt in Portugal . 
the Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises for CAD 526 million . 
in terms of revenue , Cogeco saw growth of 41.5 % . 
its revenue stands at CAD 1800 million for the current financial year . 
the net profit of its principal subsidiary , Cogeco Cable , was CAD 43.9 million down from CAD 45.7 million for the same period last year . 
Cogeco Cable saw a 45 % growth . 
the company lost 15237 customers . 
the number of Cogeco Cable customers rose by 5546 for the 2013 fiscal year . 
Audet is not concerned by this fluctuation . 
" for me , this does not indicate a change , " he noted . 
" it varies from one quarter to the next in the face of very lively competition . " 
Congolese Army Hunts Down M23 Rebels 
the Congolese army ( FARDC ) announced that its units would be hunting down M23 rebels right up to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu . 
the M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat , having been driven out of the towns in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( RDC ) , which it had been in control of since the start of the uprising . 
" we will pursue the M23 and drive it out of wherever it is hiding , " Colonel Olivier Hamuli , spokesman for the FARDC , declared . 
" we must not allow them to regroup . 
the time has come for peace to be restored . " 
leaders of the M23 say they evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bisimwa , political leader of the rebellion , asserted on RFI that these setbacks would not change its demands at the peace talks . 
talks between the government in Kinshasa and the M23 resumed in Kampala . 
skirmishes were reported in the hills above Bunagana , the last town in the hands of the rebels to fall this week , and around Runyoni , a hill where the M23 rebellion started . 
at their peak in November , the insurgents occupied Goma taking advantage of the retreat of the government garrison and the inaction of the Monusco blue berets . 
the fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo to reinforce its mandate and form a rapid intervention force . 
FARDC staff has been reshuffled and the army has gone on the offensive against the M23 , changing the course of the war . 
the rate of progress of the government troops today is unprecedented . 
" the M23 seems to be nearing its end , " predicted an expert in Congolese affairs . 
it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa has succeeded in quashing a major insurrection . 
and it would also be the first time since 1996 that there is no armed group allied to Rwanda . 
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda of providing military support to the M23 . Rwanda vehemently denies this . 
the British Foreign Secretary called on the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint , a Foreign Office spokesman announced . 
Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation after shells landed in Rwandan territory . 
on Wednesday , the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets of the town to welcome the FARDC troops . 
" we have been living with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would one day be freed , " said an inhabitant of the town on the border with Uganda . 
" we have been living in terror " the man added . 
Snowden ready to " cooperate " with Germany over US surveillance 
Edward Snowden , the US intelligence whistleblower , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director fail to provide answers about its activities . 
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him testifying . 
a letter from Snowden said : " though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as defection , and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges . " 
speaking the truth is not a crime . 
Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him . 
the charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property . 
Hans-Peter Friedrich , German interior minister , told Zeit Online : " if Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials , we will find ways to make this possible . " 
relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Merkel's phone . 
the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence said that if there were an opportunity to hear Snowden " without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US , " it should be taken . 
Mr Ströbele , an MP for Germany's Green party , published a picture of himself with Snowden on his Twitter . 
he was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists . 
Mr Ströbele said that Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left . 
if Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be " safe " , the MP said . 
Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a campaign of persecution that forced him from his home . 
he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to " my act . " 
citizens around the world as well as high officials have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service . 
the letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities .
the Minister of Defence , Rob Nicholson , insisted that injured soldiers are not discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life . 
attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons , Nicholson assured that , prior to their discharge , members of the army underwent a transition plan . 
" all injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparation for their return to civilian life , " he asserted . 
the detractors are accusing the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers to reach the ten-year period of admissibility required for retirement . 
they have specifically noted two cases reported in La Presse Canadienne . 
Lance Corporal David Hawkins , a reservist from London , Ontario , was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and discharged from the army . 
his case follows that of Lance Corporal Glen Kirkland , who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been forced to leave before . 
Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared for his departure , but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the army . 
" I told them I wasn't ready , " he said in an interview . 
" I asked if there was a way that I could stay on , and they said no , " he adds . 
since the start of major combat in Afghanistan , the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the army . 
under the current rules , seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover . 
if they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployment , they can be forced to leave . 
the data presented to parliament last year indicates that , of the 1218 soldiers discharged for medical reasons , 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement . 
the liberal spokesman for former service personnel asked for Lance Corporal Hawkins to be reinstated , while the neo-democrat Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to " this shameful practice " . 
great Opposition to Medically-Assisted Death at Palliative Care Congress 
the Canadian Palliative Care Congressncomes several days after the vote in favour of the bill on medically-assisted death in Quebec . 
several palliative care associations used the opportunity to restate their disapproval . 
" if every ill person had access to effective care to relieve their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would wish to end their lives , " said a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association , Maryse Bouvette . 
" if emphasis was put on palliative care in Canada , the call for euthanasia would become minimal , " she added . 
the Chairperson of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medically-assisted death . 
Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations . 
" what is the meaning of life ? " she laments . 
the majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die , according to the vice-president of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes , Suzanne Fitzback . 
Mrs Fitzback thinks the service would be useless anyway . 
" nobody ever says to us : ' I want to die . " 
the director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario believes that the Quebec bill is confusing people with regard to the purpose of palliative care . 
he does not believe that Ontario will follow . 
the liberal MP of Gatineau , Stephanie Vallee , thinks that the concept of termination of life needs to be clarified . 
new Class Action Claim Against Holy Cross Brothers 
a new class action claim has been filed against the brothers of the Congregation of the Holy Cross involving sexual assaults at the Saint-Joseph Oratory and several orphanages , colleges and schools . 
the claim is based on the testimony of an applicant identified as " J. J " , who would have been masturbated in the 1950s by his teacher , then by his confessor . 
" the first action involved only three institutions , and when the ruling was announced , many people said to us : ' I was assaulted at so and so place , can I add my name ? " says lawyer Alain Arsenault , who is defending the victims . 
the class action that has just been filed specifically enables the inclusion of plaintiffs from any institution  . 
currently , the action combines the complaints of 25 individuals who claim to have been assaulted . 
the deeds took place before those cited in the first action as many of the institutions concerned were closed in the 1960s . 
moreover , the action specifies that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the Saint-Joseph Oratory " allowed acts of sexual abuse to be committed against children " , that they " exercised moral , religious and psychological constraint , " and that they " knew about sexual assaults " and " consciously chose to ignore the problem " . 
the latter accusations are partly based on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers of the Holy Cross in the 1990s , as well as through research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy , who has publicly denounced the abuses . 
the class action must first be deemed admissible by the Superior Court . 
once declared admissible , it will proceed to the second stage , the preliminary hearings . 
in the first action , the Congregation of the Holy Cross agreed to settle out of court before preliminary hearings . 
children should be taught myths as " models for a way of life " , author says . 
tales of Thor could show " brute strength is no match for subtle trickery , " while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream . 
saying many of the myths would be " far too wild , " Crossley-Holland advocated a " careful selection " of age-appropriate works . 
" I find it wonderful that in America , myth and folklore already has a part in education , " he said . 
I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years . 
he added authors and teachers being " didactic " is a " total switch-off " for children , with messages being " subliminated " in enjoyable stories . 
Crossley-Holland , who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , said : " you may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight . " 
perhaps the big difference between an adult writing for an adult and an adult writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope . 
not that everything has to be simplified , but that there is an innate sense of good and evil . 
and that must be subliminated ; revealed through a story . 
the old basis of showing . 
oil extends drop toward $96 a barrel 
the price of oil continued to fall as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China's manufacturing sector is strengthening . 
US crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by morning in Europe in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
the contract fell 39 cents on Thursday . 
supplies of crude have weighed on the price in recent weeks . 
the Energy Department said that US supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week . 
over five weeks , supplies have risen by 25 million barrels . 
but a suggestion came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an uptick in activity . 
that suggests China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent . 
Brent crude , a benchmark for international crude , fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange .

Stacy Martin is not done being the topic of conversations . 
UN hails new goals to tackle poverty 
the United Nations is to start work on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle poverty . 
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for " sustainable development goals " to replace the MDGs , ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began overnight . 
they were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endorsed during the summit . 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that now is the time to " rise above national interests . " 
" I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals , " he said . 
these SDGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals , and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework . 
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate to realise our vision of sustainable development goals .

Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage 
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for carry-on luggage . 
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda . 
the new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin . 
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance , $100 if travelers wait until they're at the gate . 
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee is to get travelers to take care in advance . 
" we don't want to charge , " she said . 
airlines began charging for bags in 2008 . 
passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage . 
fees are to get passengers to bring less on board . 
O'Malley said the new charge is not about raising money . 
it's about making it clear that finding overhead bin space has become difficult . 
passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website won't pay . 
that means one passenger at a Frontier gate might bring a bag on for free , while the next person might owe $100 . 
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee . 
Frontier's new fee won't start until summer , though a date hasn't been set . 
passengers grumble about baggage charges , but airlines love them . 
they argue that luggage costs money , and passengers who want the service should pay . 
many on Wall Street view the fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost after years of losses . 
most haven't touched carry-on bag fees . 
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago , and discounter Allegiant Air followed . 
the only airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air , said airline consultant Jay Sorensen . 
he estimated in a 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year . 
a former executive with Midwest Airlines flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on fee . 
" the boarding process was the smoothest I had seen , " he said . 
I was expecting to see a fight at the gate . 
the plane was full , he said , " and it boarded lickety-split . " 
Frontier is following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee or juice . 
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the can , and it will give coffee refills for free . 
it will give away water . 
US Airways tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down later after passengers complained and no other airline followed . 
frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee is its latest effort to steer customers toward its website . 
airlines pay online travel sellers $10 to $25 for each ticket sold . 
that has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy from them instead of going through an online agency . 
Frontier has gone the furthest . 
it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online agency . 
on Wednesday it slashed the award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip . 
so , a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online agency would earn 250 miles . 
it allows passengers to choose their seat only if they buy directly from the Frontier website . 
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in Denver , but its business is losing money . 
revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to results released by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc . 
Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling . 
Bombardier profit dips 
Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit , pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries and contract issues in its train unit . 
Montreal-based Bombardier did not release any test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its schedule of going into commercial service . 
after the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flown three more times . 
results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding on the Toronto Stock Exchange . 
Cameron Doerksen , an analyst with National Bank Financial , lowered his rating on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters . 
" the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , " Doerksen said . 
we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries . 
if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that the market will become more skeptical . 
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market . 
the first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after delays . 
but firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential . 
there are currently 403 total orders and commitments . 
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use . 
Executives also reassured analysts and media the program was progressing . 
" the test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated , " Beaudoin said in a conference call . 
every manufacturer schedules it in a different way . 
we had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done . 
that will happen all through the program . 
the second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remainder following after , the company said . 
analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight . 
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service schedule and will provide an update . 
" this slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1 / 15 , " said Doerksen . 
for the third quarter , Bombardier's profit fell to $147 million from $172 million per share a year earlier . 
adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents . 
revenue dipped to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion . 
analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion . 
the world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , down from 57 a year earlier . 
net orders fell to 26 aircraft , from 83 . 
the backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30 , unchanged from December 31 . 
" in aerospace , results were in line with our guidance , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment , " Beaudoin said . 
aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion . 
Bombardier , the world's largest trainmaker , said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent .
the order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30 , up marginally from December 31 . 
the transportation division's margins were affected by issues in a few contracts . 
executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter . 
shares of Bombardier were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 on Thursday . 
Brazil's Embraer SA , the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival , reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit . 
Row Over Closure of Emergency at Hôtel-Dieu 
in light of the rebellion involving a section of the staff and several unions decided to put back the schedule for implementing the project and the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4 . 
this was an official request not to run any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter , but also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party's campaign a few months before elections . 
despite the minister's instructions , the closure is expected to take effect on this date . 
at the APHP , officials prefer the term " transformation " to closure . 
from November 4 , the units of the fire brigade will all have received instructions to take about thirty serious cases per day to the emergency units of other hospitals . 
November 4 is also the day on which hospital training resumes . 
interns specialising in emergencies will make way for five general medicine interns . 
the transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled during the month . 
" the Hôtel-Dieu emergency service has to close as soon as possible " the chairperson of the medical committee at the APHP , says straight . 
" on November 4 , patients will no longer be brought by the fire brigade , there will only be people arriving by their own means , " confirms chief medical officer at the new Hôtel-Dieu . 
" however , we will continue accepting emergency cases , " he tempers , emphasising the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site . 
" senior emergency doctors will remain on site , " he also assures . 
but the decision resides with the regional health agency ( ARS ) . 
" things are moving gradually , " says spokesman for the ARS . 
" the minister has either lied to us or has been lied to , " laments emergency medical officer , Gérald Kierzek . 
dismissed from his position as head of emergency services for taking a stand against the reorganisation project , he defines himself as a " whistle-blower " in the face of a decision taken by the medical administration body . 
" they are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units , " he believes . 
for him , " if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absorb the surplus , there wouldn't be a problem . " 
they are regularly saturated . 
for example , there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the unit at Lariboisière . 
the ARS stresses that thirty patients " despatched " to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an " avalanche " for the other emergency services . 
the ARS , like the APHP , is defending the " new hospital model and is expected to continue taking 30000 to 35000 patients a year . 
by the end of the year , self-employed GPs are also expected to participate in an " ambulatory care service " . 
" where are we heading if we start asking people to self-diagnose ? " asks Gérald Kierzek , for whom " the concept of a non-major emergency " marks a " medical step backwards " . 
" the same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units . 
people are not stupid , they will go wherever the best care is offered . " 
" if the minister does not take a step by Monday , we will take a different approach , " warns Christophe Prudhomme , emergency medical officer . 
" we will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list . " 
a UMP councillor in Paris and MP of the 4th arrondissement states that if the UMP in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at Hôtel-Dieu , it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them . 
Ann Hidalgo , the Socialist Party's candidate , repeated on France Inter that she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4 . 
if it went ahead , she would register her clear disagreement , stresses Bruno Juillard , her spokesman . 
" the reorganisation of the Hôtel-Dieu has an underlying justification , we cannot let this happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients . " 
NSA Spying 
the United States sometimes went " too far " with its espionage activities , Secretary of State John Kerry recognised in the first admission , which is deep in controversy with Europe over the collection of data by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) . 
after ten days of scandal between the United States and its European allies , this is the first time that an official has admitted controversial activities in the NSA's interception in Europe . 
" I acknowledge , as does the President , that some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future , " declared Kerry at a conference in London . 
the head of the American diplomatic service justified the intelligence practices and collection of data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism . 
citing the attacks Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted numerous attacks thanks to the interception . 
" we have been able to stay informed prior to these attacks , " the head of the American diplomatic service argued . 
Kerry stated , " I assure you that no innocent person has been misled . " 
America strives to collate data . 
" in certain cases , this went too far " the Secretary of State admitted , having already had to make a statement on the international scandal . 
he asserted that President Obama had " resolved to try to clarify the matter and had initiated a re-examination of these practices " . 
but the controversy between the Americans and Europeans continued to grow  . 
according to the Washington Post , the NSA has been intercepting data of hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users . 
the newspaper , which quotes documents obtained by the former NSA consultant , stated that the programme conducted in conjunction with the British counterpart of the NSA , the GCHQ , enabled the two agencies to gather data from the cables used by Internet giants . 
according to the documents , some 181 million items were collected during the month of January alone . 
interceptions took place outside the USA . 
Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement . 
for ten days , a number of major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain and Italy have been revealing that the NSA had intercepted massive quantities of data emanating from allies of the United States . 
following the outrage of the European states , and leaks to the American press stated that the President was not up-to-date with these activities , Obama has refused to comment on the matter . 
the head of the powerful NSA , General Keith Alexander , denied that his intelligence agency had captured communications from European citizens . 
he even pointed the finger back at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold of these communications before . 
this concerned " military operations " in countries where the NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and this did not target Europe . 
the discord spread to Asia . 
Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador , which has aroused the ire of China . 
end of the Road for Elysée Head Chef 
having entered the kitchens at the Elysée Palace as an assistant , the cook climbed up the ladder to become head chef nine years ago . 
he has served six French presidents and fed an number of world figures , surrounded by a cloud of anonymity , as he retires at 60 . 
the man with an open face is the holder of a certificate of professional competence in confectionery . 
his mother was a cook . 
" I've moved from one château to another ! " says Bernard Vaussion . he is familiar , not only with the habits of the six presidents , but also with those of their wives and some of their guests . 
" it's always the Head of State or his partner or wife who chooses the menu , " he recalls . 
" Madame Chirac was a little more involved and would come into the kitchen , " she forbade women to enter the kitchens in the Elysée Palace ! 
with all due respect to heads of state , " they are all fond of food " Vaussion reveals . 
Jacques Chirac had a " more refined palate " . 
but with Nicolas Sarkozy , who forbade cheese , the plates always came back empty ! 
Francois Hollande is " a man who likes to eat " and " is not very choosy " . 
the current Head of State does " not have a specific diet requirement " . 
Vaussion recalls the pressure during state dinners at the Elysée . 
the night before would be sleepless . 
such people would not understand if something went wrong . 
the now former head chef at the Elysée is leaving with a twinge of sorrow . " Francois Hollande came to say goodbye . " 
he was full of praise . 
" his human side came out , " he recalls . 
the chef will be replaced by his assistant . 
court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy 
a federal appeals court blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case . 
the 2nd U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city . 
the judge had ruled the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people . 
the city appealed her findings and her remedial orders , including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy . 
the appeals court heard arguments on the requested stay . 
the appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality . 
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program . 
she appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras . 
New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop . 
an oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14 , 2014 . 
the stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates . 
stop-and-frisk has been around for decades , but recorded stops increased under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg . 
a lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case . 
supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and can affect how other police departments use the policy . 
opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure . 
the judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice , but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops . 
two potholders aged 23 and 27 went missing in a cave under the Dent de Crolles on Thursday , according to a report from the Isère cave rescue organization . 
they were found on Friday afternoon . 
the two men set off underground on Thursday at around 9.30pm , in an attempt to cross the Dent des Crolles . 
there was no news of them after , said the same source . 
" the potholders were due to return at around 5am , " said Thierry Larribe , technical consultant at the cave-rescue organization who organized the rescue . 
dozens of people on site 
twenty or so rescuers , ten civilian members of the cave-rescue organization , as well as the police , mountain rescue services and firefighters were on hand . 
the two potholders were found late on Friday afternoon . 
" another group of potholders found them in the hollow exhausted but in good health and got a message to one of the rescue teams , " explained local newspaper . 
the two men , who are soldiers stationed in Chambéry , were found " exhausted but uninjured " . 
they got lost in the network , but retraced their steps while waiting for assistance , said the police . 
being given supplies , they are expected to exit in the evening with the help of the rescuers . 
rehousing Due to Rats Causes Strife in La Seyne 
at the start of this week , a family abandoned its ground floor apartment because of the rats . 
in view of the urgency , the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office offered to provide exceptional rehousing for the couple and their children in a new house . 
the family refused " for financial reasons " and the situation is at stalemate . 
" the matter has become exaggerated , " thinks Joël Canapa , office director . 
" there have always been rats . 
the rat extermination company conducts two operations per year . we intervene at our own cost whenever there is a complaint . 
we have carried out 64 operations since last winter . 
the area has not been abandoned and rats are not swarming . 
due to environmental protection and public health , rat extermination products are four times less efficient than in the past , but we are not going to kill a kid for the sake of two rats . " 
" we didn't invite the rats in , " counters the father of the family , which left its home  . 
" we will soon be penniless and we are waiting for a new house at the same rate as the old one . " 
woman Tries Smuggling Cocaine Inside Pumpkins 
taking advantage of Halloween , a woman tried to smuggle cocaine hidden inside pumpkins into the country through Montreal-Trudeau Airport . 
the drugs were detected when luggage was checked . 
the cocaine was split between pumpkins previously hollowed out . 
the drugs were subsequently taken to the office of the Royal Gendarmerie . 
the Canada Border Services Agency did not reveal where the woman had been travelling from when she was intercepted . 
" that is part of the investigation , " indicated Jacqueline Roby , spokesperson for the CBSA . 
" she was entering the country . " 
since the start of 2013 , the Canada Border Services Agency at Montreal-Trudeau Airport has conducted 173 drugs seizures . 
in 2012 the Border Services Agency for the province of Quebec made 1653 seizures . 
Abortion Law in Texas Challenged 
a federal appeal court in Texas has reintroduced restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy , which had been blocked by a trial judge this week . 
the decision means that a legal text adopted in the state in July challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force . 
the decision means that doctors who practise abortion will need to have an " admitting privilege " with hospitals . 
an admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital to carry out a procedure , based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital . 
defenders of abortion stress that the law may lead to the closure of a third of clinics in the state , as these clinics have failed to obtain the admitting privilege . 
nearly 22000 women will be deprived of access to such establishments . 
the day before the law was due to come into force a trial judge considered that the provisions pertaining to admitting privileges were unconstitutional . 
but the Attorney General for Texas asked the court to overturn the judgement from the trial court blocking the application of the law . 
a plenary hearing is scheduled in January . 
House Engulfed in Flames in Old Quebec 
a fire that started on Friday in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control . 
more than thirty firemen rushed to 9 Rue Hébert . 
the fire started in a house behind the yard of the Quebec Seminary . 
all the tenants were out . 
the fire was brought under control an hour after the firemen arrived . 
as the first firemen arrived , they could see the smoke . 
" the alarms went off one after the other as it took reinforcements to deal with the building , " explained France Loiselle , spokesperson for the Quebec fire service . 
an investigation is under way . 
tenants have to go and vote , as each of them pays an average of $100 a month in the cost of their accommodation that goes to the City . 
if the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes , he divides this figure between each house . 
we are forced to increase the rent . 
by going to vote , we are sending a message . 
we need to change things . 
the candidates have told us that they would tackle this debt . 
we no longer have the means to pay $100,000 for fireworks , $4-5 million for land ... 
go and vote , that is the best way to express yourself . 
Air Raid Against Military Installations in Syria 
Israeli aircrafts entered Lebanese air space on Wednesday afternoon , but did not carry out attacks until the evening , according to the Lebanese army . 
a cargo of short range missiles was targeted and destroyed . 
this latest raid by the Israeli air force in Syrian territory has been confirmed neither by Israel nor Syria . 
the raid took place under circumstances almost identical to that of July 5 : it was also an unnamed American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack that targeted Yakhont ground-to-air missiles . 
Israeli officials made no attempt to hide their anger when Washington revealed the attack  . 
Menton Reduces Cost of Christmas Lights 
with 420 patterned designs and 2.2 kilometers of sea front in a mantle of light , the bill for the illuminations in Menton could give you a shock . 
unlike in many communes , the bill is met by taxpayers rather than by business associations . 
the town has decided to use LEDs to reduce costs . 
there has also been a change in the management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations . 
Paris Saint-Germain will face Lorient on Friday without Zlatan Ibrahimovic suffering from an injury the Ligue 1 club announced in a press release . 
PSG , who are top of the league on goal difference , issued the team sheet for the match on which the striker did not appear . 
the press release said that he is " injured " , without saying what the injury was . 
however , he was suffering from an inflammation on the left knee . 
five years ago , my father passed away . 
at first , I was in denial . I spoke of him in the present tense .
I was afraid of forgetting him , or I did not know how I was going to " spend time " with him . 
there is no formula for passing through the wall of the invisible .
then signs started to appear . 
the first time I had this feeling of his presence , he was in the passenger seat while I was driving .
another time I quietly woke up and went to look at his watch . 
the smiling image of my father stays with me during my everyday activities . 
our mother left us after an fight against cancer .
that is what I thought when I saw her stiff body under the sheets of the hospital bed . 
her funeral was a cold goodbye focused on the light of candles . 
I thought she had gone . 
gradually , by way of faint appearances , she came back into my life , evolving as she took back her place in my mind .
then she revealed herself by showing me aspects of myself I had never seen before .
I learnt that I had not lost my mother , just a woman that I did not know well .
in dying , this woman had completed her life and freed the person that I loved , and now she was back . 
this detour in my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing .
it is a privilege that the people we love never leave us .
I am " inside and out " . 
I have always been told that . 
I never believed it at the time . 
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old and ill . 
I was no longer afraid of him and able to love him .
one day , he died . 
for a long time , he stayed with me - when I stopped smoking , was afraid , was ill ...
he would speak to me , encourage me , he lived in my body . 
I would see his hands when I looked at mine ; I lent him my body . 
but this was never indiscreet . 
I could still lead a personal life . 
he allowed me privacy .
that lasted a long time , then one day he was gone . 
in the end , it felt comfortable to be understood , encouraged , advised .
I don't know who said that those who die are not forgotten but invisible .
my parents are no longer here but close to me constantly . 
in every event I feel their presence , always referring to them : what would they say , think , do ? 
I dream of them several times a week .
I often dream of the last moments I shared with them , except that one thing prevents me from enjoying the moment . 
I wake up distressed because it hits me and I feel their absence deeply .
dreams affect me differently , so they continue to live and be a part of my life . 
on the day before I was going to find out the gender of my baby I dreamt that I woke up and my father was waiting for me . he was smiling and was happy that I was expecting a little boy . 
the following day , I had the feeling that he had come to visit me in my dream to tell me he was sharing the joy . 
I was indeed carrying a boy . 
I loved sharing that moment with him and enjoy talking of that shared memory .
exactly five years ago , my grandmother died .
one year previously , she had travelled with my family to Cuba . 
hence the shock that provoked in the young graduate I was .
in spite of everything , I said my goodbyes quickly . 
but she continues to influence my life , particularly through hard times .
deciding to learn Arabic and pursuing an interest in the Middle East were not trivial decisions . 
I used to listen to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she had lived before coming back to France .
the values she instilled in me are still there , so I often end up wondering what she would want me to do .
it's the same with my opinions : I try to live up to the generosity and correctness of her mind . 
I feel her as a daily presence .
I see her eyes on me .
my mother died nineteen years ago .
she died after talking to me on the telephone . 
I went through all the stages : incomprehension , anger , grief , tears , anywhere , anytime . 
but time eased the pain . 
now there is just the gap , the need for her to entrust me , to reassure me . 
yet , she is there , a silent presence .
every morning I see her eyes looking at me , the dark rings giving her a burdened look , the wrinkles around the lips , the lines that mark the forehead . 
my mother has taken possession of my face , and she looks back at me in the mirror .
and every morning , I look away . 
my wife and the mother of my children died of cancer at 43 . 
we always feel her protecting us .
this was her promise on her death bed ; gradually , saying her name is no longer taboo but a comfort . 
I talk to her when the absence hurts too much , and she comes into my dreams when my spirits are low . 
we feel supported in difficult moments , and time has made us realise that she was the conductor . 
if somebody truly loved you , their absence cannot tear them out your heart . 
the person you loved becomes your inner energy . 
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer . 
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he would have thought or appreciated . 
I was unable to attend his burial , and three weeks after his death gave birth to a boy . 
sometimes my beliefs are different from his , always asking myself if what I am doing conforms with his way of seeing things . 
I have even had problems at work because of these convictions . 
I can't do otherwise ; I lose sleep and constantly ask myself what he would think .
I don't know if I have adopted his way of thinking or am simply like him ? 
he will always be my point of reference . 
he was like an alter ego , we didn't even need to speak . 
in short , he is there every day .
I feel his presence and it makes me happy . 
almost thirty years ago , my husband died aged 33 . 
I was 28 and our son was 6 . 
the immense pain that engulfed me has eased , but he is still close to me . 
he often " turns up " in my dreams in a way so vivid that when I wake up I am sad again when I realise it was a dream . 
the other night , he asked how I was ; I said not good , and he said " I'm coming down " , in a voice so real that I woke up and switched on the bedside lamp and looked around , convinced that he would come . 
I live in the same house and feel he is watching me ; I turn round and see he isn't there but know it's him and I talk to him . 
I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy . 
I wouldn't leave this house for anything . we were happy here and his spirit lives here with me . 
I'm 58 and I have always lived alone since losing him . he is and will remain the love of my life . 
I am rather sociable and have a job with responsibilities . I laugh and sing , go out , 'm a grandmother , have lots of friends , but my heart and soul belong to him . I never talk about him except with my son and never go to the cemetery .

a feast for fans 
not tired of making surprises , Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeves
the Thin White Duke was also planning to re-release the album on November 04 .

he presents each of the disks plus the accessories : exclusive photos and sleeves , a notebook for sharing impressions , a booklet of lyrics etc . 
he gives a teaser to his new track , Atomica , in the style of The Next Day , with prominent guitars and controlled rock electrics . 
Previously Unpublished Tracks Released

with this track , the singer seems to be in his element his feet no longer on the ground .
Space Oddity was much more solemn . 
on Born in a UFO , Bowie refers to his strangeness : could he have come from another planet ?
the spellbinding guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth .
Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon in these tracks : in turn , an informer , a rocket man , possibly a Martian ...

he appears in one of their adverts , broadcast from November 10 . 
Difficult Year for Pharmacists 
the departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Health and Social Services ( CSSS ) in Laval has caused turmoil amidst the managers of the Cité-de-la-Santé hospital in 2012-2013 .
the pharmacy department has been left short-staffed following departures due to retirement , maternity leave or resignations . 
there is a staff shortage of almost 30 % , making the financial year " very difficult " according to department head , Gillian Beaudet .
the CSSS has decided not to employ independent labour , which could be up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist . 
" we didn't resort to a stop-gap solution , " explained Beaudet . 
" we consolidated or reduced some of our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for things to fall back in place . 
we clearly worked hard on trying to persuade our young [ LEFT-BRACKET pharmacy residents ] to come and stay here . 
a combination of circumstances put us in a difficult situation last year . "
improved situation 
after this difficult period , 2013-2014 looks like a easier one .
three pharmacists have returned to work after maternity leave and three others have been taken on . 
the efforts made to hold on to staff have paid off , as the four students currently in residence in Laval have decided to stay .
" things are much better now , " stressed the pharmacist . 
" by the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmacists and three back . 
so that will fill the gaps we had last year . "
need still growing 
however , the situation is still precarious . 
several factors , such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession , make situations difficult to predict .
" for us [ LEFT-BRACKET the number of staff ] is always precarious as a lot of young women are being employed . so you can always count on three people being on maternity leave , " she added .
" last year there were many more and no pharmacists available to replace them . " 
Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law 
" it is a frightening place , and it is valid to ask : what is there to prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? " the paper said , challenging the bill as unconstitutional . 
" this law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , " said Cyrus Kamau , managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM , one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites . 
he said the new media tribunal " will always be biased because it's an extension of the government , " and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy . 
" I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill , " he said .
according to The Star newspaper , the bill will hand the government " a stranglehold over the media , " while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been " dealt a major blow " .
the passing of the bill comes amid measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen .
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops dispatched to the scene of the attack . 
police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning , although the summons was retracted following a media outcry . 
under the bill , media houses can be fined and individual journalists with the additional risk of being barred from receiving official press accreditation .
the tribunal also has the power to seize property if a fine is not paid .
according to the Daily Nation , " even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations . " 
the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's " lively blogosphere . "
by silencing the media , politicians can do whatever they like with impunity .
" no one will ever know , " wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu , describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life . 
" left to themselves , politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering , " he wrote . 
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past . 
in May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries ranked among the highest in the world .
Delta Centre-Ville Closes 
Delta Centre-Ville Hotel in Montreal closed on Thursday after 36 years . 
the investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will convert it into student residences .
the hotel had three hundred and fifty employees .
200 have still not found a new job . 
Delta has promised not to abandon its employees .
employers have come to meet employees on site and have met employees individually .
" that support will continue for the next six months , " explains the regional labour relations director at Delta hotels .
the closure comes at a time of great competitiveness in the hotel market .
the investment fund had to make a choice .
it had to either reinvest in the building , which would require investments worth millions of dollars while competition is fierce .
or sell it , what happened , " explains the Transat Chair in Tourism at the School of Management at the UQAM .
other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months .
meanwhile , four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will be implemented in the next two years .
NSA Blames " internal Error , " not Hackers , For Website Crash 
the shadowy National Security Agency said Friday that a glitch brought down its public website , not hackers as some claimed . 
" NSA. gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , " the agency said in an emailed statement .
the issue will be resolved this evening . 
claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [ LEFT-BRACKET DDoS ] attack are not true . 
server trackers noted the website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be inaccessible for some . 
earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the internal network was " not at all " compromised . 
no classified information is in danger .
one hacktivist group claimed they were responsible for bringing down the site with a DDoS attack . 
DDOS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses . 
the tactic is unsophisticated and not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system . 
the NSA has found itself in very public light in past months following revelations about is foreign and domestic surveillance programs - the product of secret files stolen and leaked by Edward Snowden .
such growing controversy prompted speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted operation . 
classical Singing for Teenagers 
the student body has been the target of an initiative that had a lot of success last season .

two other concerts will be held in the summer of 2014 , giving regional artists the chance to show what they are capable of .
there was the Apéro Lyrique , the benefit concert held last August , with the support of coloratura soprano , Marie-Eve Munger . 
this was a benefit event which helps the non-profit organisation achieve financial balance-sheet .
the Chairperson of the Board of Directors used the press conference held yesterday to give assurances .
despite the precarious situation that many cultural institutions face , the future looks bright .
we have more solid and stable support . 
" finances are on an even keel and we hope to see the 50th anniversary of the operetta , a milestone we will reach in seven years , " the administrator remarked . 
" I would even say beyond that , " added the general manager .

Obama Ends Spying on IMF and World Bank 
Obama has ordered the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to stop tapping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , said an American official on Thursday .
this decision is part of attempts by the White House to resume control following revelations by former analyst Edward Snowden who has taken refuge in Russia .
this is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and World Bank has been mentioned since the start of the scandal .

talking under anonymity , the official did not specify whether such surveillance had taken place in the past . 
another official indicated that Obama had given the order to stop these practices .
the instruction was given at almost the same time as that putting an end to phone-tapping of the UN headquarters in New York .

School Transport : complaint Judged Admissible 
since the beginning of the academic year , the Sherbrooke Region School Board ( CSRS ) has been demanding a $150 fee per student ( to a maximum of $300 per family ) for using school transport to get to two addresses .
no financial contribution had been demanded prior to the changes to the last budget .

cranes arrived after 10am , and traffic on the main road was diverted .

traffic returned to normal at around 6am . 
tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus turned out negative , the Ministry of Health has announced . 
it specified that " the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only confirmed cases in France to date . " 
the 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being infected on Tuesday , returning from Saudi Arabia , where the disease has already killed about fifty people .
